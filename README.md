# Hi there, I'm Josiah ðŸ‘‹

[Turbo](https://turbo.computer) CTO, game dev, and low-level Rust enjoyer. I build 2D game engines, trustless game servers, and mess around with cryptography.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Turbo](https://turbo.computer)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WGSL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Turbo's Rust SDK](https://github.com/super-turbo-society/turbo-genesis-sdk)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Turbo Demos](https://github.com/super-turbo-society/turbo-demos)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about WebGPU/WebAssembly/Rust/TypeScript

## What I'm Building:
- [Turbo](https://turbo.computer) â€“ A game engine making netcode-enabled 2D games 10x faster.
- [Turbo OS](https://os.turbo.computer) â€“ A real-time authoritative game server built for indies.
- [Dungeon Dash](https://play.turbo.computer/dungeon-dash) â€“ A trustless dungeon crawler built with Turbo and running on Turbo OS.

## Notable Experiments:
- Built a 2D game engine from scratch.
- Built a real-time authoritative game server with a Wasm execution layer.
- Inadvertently, created a viral memecoin and built web game where players could earn it with skill-based challenges.
- Exploring Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for gaming privacy & computation.

## Tech I Like:
- ðŸ¦€ Rust â€“ For anything performance-critical.
- ðŸ‘¾ WebGPU & WGSL â€“ For pushing pixels.
- ðŸ¥« WebAssembly â€“ Because bytecode is the sauce.

ðŸ’¬ Always experimenting, always shipping. Hit me up if youâ€™re working on cool stuff!
